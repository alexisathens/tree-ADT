# tree-ADT
Implementing a tree ADT (abstract data type) was my final project for Data Structures & Algorithms (COP3530). Though binary search trees are available in C++'s standard template library, we created 4 different versions of it from scratch to make the tree's structure more adaptable. (These versions were a BST where new values were inserted at the root, a BST where new values were inserted at a leaf, a BST where new values were inserted randomly in the tree, and a self-balancing BST called an AVL.) With each version of the tree, we defined the following functions: insert (will sort given value into tree), remove (will remove leaf at given key), lookup (returns value at given key), print tree preorder, print tree inorder, and some more basic functions.
